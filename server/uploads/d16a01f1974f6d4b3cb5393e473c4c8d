=====>>>>>>why we should use oops


1.	it makes development and maintenance easier where as in procedure-oriented
	programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as project 
	size grows.

2.	it provides data hiding whereas in procedure-oriented programming language a global
	data can be accessed from anywhere.

3.	program will also be simple if we use concept of oops because we dont have to write 
	the same code repeatedly because oops provide concept of inheritance.
